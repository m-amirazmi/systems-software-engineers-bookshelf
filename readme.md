Hi there,

here is a list of books and resources I'm reading, have read, or plan to read to educate myself in computer science. 
My goals is to become a [systems programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_programming) (especially for video games, but not only) 
and generally a well rounded software engieer with rock solid background in computer science.

From this [wikipedia outline of computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_computer_science) below is a list of subjects 
I am interested in, ordered by how important they are for me.

This list is still WIP, I'm still filling in the columns and adding links, as well as adding/removing/reordering books.

I'd love your feedback, especially about what other books I could add to the list, or which are unecessary or not the best choice. 
I'm especially keen on "cult classics" or traditional classics and I am aiming at having really solid fundamentals in computer science 
and software engineering
